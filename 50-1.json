Bowie wails with crazed soul about two doomed lovers finding a moment of redemption together \u2014 just for one day.<\/p>\n","alt":"","image_credit":"","url":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/music-lists\/best-songs-of-all-time-1224767\/","image":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/23-david-bowie-heroes.jpeg?w=306&h=306&crop=1","sizes":{"pmc-gallery-s":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/23-david-bowie-heroes.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-m":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/23-david-bowie-heroes.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-l":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/23-david-bowie-heroes.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-xl":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/23-david-bowie-heroes.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-xxl":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/23-david-bowie-heroes.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306}},"fullWidth":306,"fullHeight":306,"mime_type":"image","ad":"","appleSongID":"1347894092","enableAppleGA":false,"ads":{"html":"\t<div class=\"admz\" id=\"adm-in-list-x\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"adma boomerang\" data-device=\"Desktop\" data-width=\"728\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div style=\"min-width:50px;min-height:75px;\"\n\tclass=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\"\n\tdata-priority=\"8\"\n>\n\t<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid27\"\n\t\tclass=\"adw-728 adh-90\" data-is-adhesion-ad=\"\">\n\t\t<script type=\"application\/javascript\">\n\t\t\tblogherads.adq.push(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblogherads\n\t\t\t\t\t.defineSlot( 'flexbanner', 'gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid27' )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"in-listX\",\"btf\",\"inbodyX\"] )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setSubAdUnitPath(\"music\\\/list\\\/inbodyX\")\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.addSize([[970,250],[728,90],[970,90],[970,125],[3,3]])\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setLazyLoadMultiplier(2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t<\/script>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n","data":[{"divId":"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid27","displayType":"flexbanner","targeting":[{"key":"pos","value":"mid"},{"key":"pos","value":"in-listX"},{"key":"pos","value":"btf"},{"key":"pos","value":"inbodyX"}],"lazyLoad":"yes","zone":"music\/list\/inbodyX","sizes":[[970,250],[728,90],[970,90],[970,125],[3,3]]}]}},{"ID":1225316,"position":478,"positionDisplay":22,"date":"2021-09-13 14:22:04","modified":"2021-09-13 22:21:38","title":"The Ronettes, 'Be My Baby'","subtitle":"<div class=\"rs-list-item--year\">1963<\/div><div class=\"rs-list-item--credits\"><span class=\"rs-list-item--credits__heading\">Writer(s):<\/span><span class=\"rs-list-item--credits__names\">Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich, Phil Spector<\/span><\/div>","slug":"the-ronettes-be-my-baby-2-1225316","caption":"","description":"<p>Phil Spector rehearsed this song with Ronnie Bennett (the only Ronette to sing on it) for weeks, but that didn&#8217;t stop him from doing 42 takes before he was satisfied.

In 1970, Marvin Gaye was Motown&#8217;s top male vocal star, yet he was frustrated by the assembly-line role he played on his own hits. Devastated by the loss of duet partner Tammi Terrell, who died that March after a three-year battle with a brain tumor, Gaye was also trapped in a turbulent marriage to Anna Gordy, Motown boss Berry Gordy&#8217;s sister. Gaye was tormented, too, by his relationship with his puritanical father, Marvin Sr.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If I was arguing for peace,&#8221; Gaye told biographer David Ritz, &#8220;I knew I&#8217;d have to find peace in my heart.&#8221; Not long after Terrell&#8217;s passing, Renaldo Benson of the Four Tops presented Gaye with a song he had written with Motown staffer Al Cleveland. But Gaye made the song his own, overseeing the arrangement and investing the topical references to war and racial strife with private anguish. Motown session crew the Funk Brothers cut the stunning, jazz-inflected rhythm track (Gaye joined in with cardboard-box percussion). Then Gaye invoked his own family in moving prayer: singing to his younger brother Frankie, a Vietnam veteran (&#8220;Brother, brother, brother\/There&#8217;s far too many of you dying&#8221;), and appealing for calm closer to home (&#8220;Father, father, father\/We don&#8217;t need to escalate&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>Initially rejected as uncommercial, &#8220;What&#8217;s Going On&#8221; (with background vocals by two players from the Detroit Lions) was Gaye&#8217;s finest studio achievement, a timeless gift of healing.<\/p>\n","alt":"","image_credit":"","url":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/music-lists\/best-songs-of-all-time-1224767\/","image":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/6-marvin-gaye-whats-going-on.jpeg?w=306&h=306&crop=1","sizes":{"pmc-gallery-s":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/6-marvin-gaye-whats-going-on.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-m":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/6-marvin-gaye-whats-going-on.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-l":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/6-marvin-gaye-whats-going-on.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-xl":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/6-marvin-gaye-whats-going-on.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-xxl":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/6-marvin-gaye-whats-going-on.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306}},"fullWidth":306,"fullHeight":306,"mime_type":"image","ad":"","appleSongID":"1538081594","enableAppleGA":false,"ads":{"html":"\t<div class=\"admz\" id=\"adm-in-list-x\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"adma boomerang\" data-device=\"Desktop\" data-width=\"728\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div style=\"min-width:50px;min-height:75px;\"\n\tclass=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\"\n\tdata-priority=\"8\"\n>\n\t<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid44\"\n\t\tclass=\"adw-728 adh-90\" data-is-adhesion-ad=\"\">\n\t\t<script type=\"application\/javascript\">\n\t\t\tblogherads.adq.push(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblogherads\n\t\t\t\t\t.defineSlot( 'flexbanner', 'gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid44' )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"in-listX\",\"btf\",\"inbodyX\"] )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setSubAdUnitPath(\"music\\\/list\\\/inbodyX\")\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.addSize([[970,250],[728,90],[970,90],[970,125],[3,3]])\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setLazyLoadMultiplier(2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t<\/script>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n","data":[{"divId":"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid44","displayType":"flexbanner","targeting":[{"key":"pos","value":"mid"},{"key":"pos","value":"in-listX"},{"key":"pos","value":"btf"},{"key":"pos","value":"inbodyX"}],"lazyLoad":"yes","zone":"music\/list\/inbodyX","sizes":[[970,250],[728,90],[970,90],[970,125],[3,3]]}]}},{"ID":1225333,"position":495,"positionDisplay":5,"date":"2021-09-13 14:22:08","modified":"2021-09-15 14:09:06","title":"Nirvana, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'","subtitle":"<div class=\"rs-list-item--year\">1991<\/div><div class=\"rs-list-item--credits\"><span class=\"rs-list-item--credits__heading\">Writer(s):<\/span><span class=\"rs-list-item--credits__names\">Kurt Cobain<\/span><\/div>","slug":"nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit-5-1225333","caption":"","description":"<p>Producer Butch Vig first heard &#8220;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#8221; in early 1991, on a boombox cassette recorded by bassist Krist Novoselic, drummer Dave Grohl, and singer-guitarist-songwriter Kurt Cobain in a barn in Tacoma, Washington. The fidelity was abysmal. Vig \u2014 about to work with Nirvana on their major-label debut, <i>Nevermind<\/i> \u2014 could not tell that the song would soon make underground Seattle rock the new mainstream and catapult Cobain, a troubled young man with strict indie-culture ethics, into mega-celebrity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I could sort of hear the &#8216;Hello, hello&#8217; part and the chords,&#8221; Vig said years later. &#8220;But it was so indecipherable that I had no idea what to expect.&#8221; &#8220;Teen Spirit&#8221; was Cobain&#8217;s attempt to &#8220;write the ultimate pop song,&#8221; he said, using the soft-loud dynamic of his favorite band, the Pixies. The insidious hooks also showed his admiration for John Lennon. Cobain &#8220;had that dichotomy of punk rage and alienation,&#8221; Vig said, &#8220;but also this vulnerable pop sensibility. In &#8216;Teen Spirit,&#8217; a lot of that vulnerability is in the tone of his voice.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, by the time of Nirvana&#8217;s last U.S. tour, in late 1993, Cobain was tortured by the obligation to play &#8220;Teen Spirit&#8221; every night. &#8220;There are many other songs that I have written that are as good, if not better,&#8221; he claimed. But few songs by any artist have reshaped rock and roll so immediately, and permanently.<\/p>\n","alt":"","image_credit":"","url":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/music-lists\/best-songs-of-all-time-1224767\/","image":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/5-nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit.jpeg?w=306&h=306&crop=1","sizes":{"pmc-gallery-s":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/5-nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-m":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/5-nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-l":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/5-nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-xl":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/5-nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306},"pmc-gallery-xxl":{"src":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/5-nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit.jpeg?w=306","width":306,"height":306}},"fullWidth":306,"fullHeight":306,"mime_type":"image","ad":"","appleSongID":"1440783625","enableAppleGA":false,"ads":{"html":"\t<div class=\"admz\" id=\"adm-in-list-x\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"adma boomerang\" data-device=\"Desktop\" data-width=\"728\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div style=\"min-width:50px;min-height:75px;\"\n\tclass=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\"\n\tdata-priority=\"8\"\n>\n\t<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid45\"\n\t\tclass=\"adw-728 adh-90\" data-is-adhesion-ad=\"\">\n\t\t<script type=\"application\/javascript\">\n\t\t\tblogherads.adq.push(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblogherads\n\t\t\t\t\t.defineSlot( 'flexbanner', 'gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid45' )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"in-listX\",\"btf\",\"inbodyX\"] )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setSubAdUnitPath(\"music\\\/list\\\/inbodyX\")\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.addSize([[970,250],[728,90],[970,90],[970,125],[3,3]])\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setLazyLoadMultiplier(2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t<\/script>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n","data":[{"divId":"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid45","displayType":"flexbanner","targeting":[{"key":"pos","value":"mid"},{"key":"pos","value":"in-listX"},{"key":"pos","value":"btf"},{"key":"pos","value":"inbodyX"}],"lazyLoad":"yes","zone":"music\/list\/inbodyX","sizes":[[970,250],[728,90],[970,90],[970,125],[3,3]]}]}},{"ID":1225334,"position":496,"positionDisplay":4,"date":"2021-09-13 14:22:08","modified":"2021-09-13 22:14:52","title":"Bob Dylan, 'Like a Rolling Stone'","subtitle":"<div class=\"rs-list-item--year\">1965<\/div><div class=\"rs-list-item--credits\"><span class=\"rs-list-item--credits__heading\">Writer(s):<\/span><span class=\"rs-list-item--credits__names\">Bob Dylan<\/span><\/div>","slug":"bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-3-1225334","caption":"","description":"<p>\u201cI wrote it.

But Franklin took possession of the song for all time with her definitive cover, cut at Atlantic&#8217;s New York studio on Valentine&#8217;s Day 1967. &#8220;Respect&#8221; was her first Number One hit and the single that established her as the Queen of Soul.<\/p>\n<p>In Redding&#8217;s reading, a brawny march, he called for equal favor with volcanic force. Franklin wasn&#8217;t <em>asking<\/em> for anything. She sang from higher ground: a woman calling for an end to the exhaustion and sacrifice of a raw deal with scorching sexual authority. In short: If you want some, you will earn it. &#8220;For Otis, &#8216;respect&#8217; had the traditional connotation, the more abstract meaning of esteem,&#8221; Wexler said in his autobiography, <i>Rhythm and the Blues: A Life in American Music<\/i>. &#8220;The fervor in Aretha&#8217;s magnificent voice demanded that respect and more: Respect also involved sexual attention of the highest order. What else could &#8216;Sock it to me&#8217; mean?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He was referring to the knockout sound of Franklin&#8217;s backup singers \u2014 her sisters, Carolyn and Erma \u2014 chanting &#8220;Sock it to me&#8221; at high speed, which Aretha and Carolyn cooked up for the session. The late Tom Dowd, who engineered the date, credited Carolyn with the saucy breakdown in which Aretha spelled out the title: &#8220;I fell off my chair when I heard that!&#8221; And since Redding&#8217;s version had no bridge, Wexler had the band \u2014 the legendary studio crew from Muscle Shoals, Alabama \u2014 play the chord changes from Sam and Dave&#8217;s &#8220;When Something Is Wrong With My Baby&#8221; under King Curtis&#8217; tenor-sax solo.<\/p>\n<p>There is no mistaking the passion inside the discipline of Franklin&#8217;s delivery; she was surely drawing on her own tumultuous marriage at the time for inspiration. &#8220;If she didn&#8217;t live it,&#8221; Wexler said, &#8220;she couldn&#8217;t give it.&#8221; But, he added, &#8220;Aretha would never play the part of the scorned woman.\u2026 Her middle name was Respect.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Leading off her Atlantic debut, <i>I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You<\/i>, \u201cRespect\u201d catalyzed rock &amp; roll, gospel, and blues to create the model for soul music that artists still look to today (Mariah Carey called Franklin &#8220;my mentor&#8221;). Just as important, the song\u2019s unapologetic demands resonated powerfully with the civil rights movement and emergent feminist revolution, fitting for an artist who donated to the Black Panther
